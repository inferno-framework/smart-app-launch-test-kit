      The [SMART App Launch 2.0.0 IG specification for Backend Services](https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/STU2/backend-services.html#issue-access-token)
      states The access token response SHALL be a JSON object with the following properties:

      | Token Property | Required? | Description |
      | --- | --- | --- |
      | `access_token` | required | The access token issued by the authorization server. |
      | `token_type` | required | Fixed value: `bearer`. |
      | `expires_in` | required | The lifetime in seconds of the access token. The recommended value is `300`, for a five-minute token lifetime. |
