# Inferno SMART App Launch Test Kit

This is a collection of tests for the [SMART Application Launch Framework
Implementation Guide](http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/index.html) using the
[Inferno Framework](https://inferno-framework.github.io/inferno-core/), verifying
that a server can provide authorization and/or authentication services to client 
applications accessing HL7速 FHIR速 APIs.

## Instructions

- Clone this repo.
- Run `setup.sh` in this repo.
- Run `run.sh` in this repo.
- Navigate to `http://localhost`. The SMART test suite will be available.

## Versions
This test kit contains both the SMART App Launch STU1 and SMART App Launch STU2
suites. While these suites are generally designed to test implementations of
the SMART App Launch Framework, each suite is tailored to the
[STU1](https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/1.0.0/) and
[STU2](http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/STU2/) versions of SMART, respectively.

## Importing tests

Tests from this test kit can be imported to perform the SMART App Launch
workflow as part of another test suite. The tests are arranged in groups which
can be easily reused.

In order for the redirect and launch urls to be determined correctly, make sure
that the `INFERNO_HOST` environment variable is populated in `.env` with the
scheme and host where inferno will be hosted.

### Example

```ruby
require 'smart_app_launch_test_kit'

class MySuite < Inferno::TestSuite
  input :url

  group do
    title 'Auth'

    group from: :smart_discovery
    group from: :smart_standalone_launch
    group from: :smart_openid_connect
  end

  group do
    title 'Make some HL7速 FHIR速 requests using SMART credentials'

    input :smart_credentials

    fhir_client do
      url :url
      oauth_credentials :smart_credentials # Obtained from the auth group
    end

    test do
      title 'Retrieve patient from SMART launch context'

      input :patient_id

      run do
        fhir_read(:patient, patient_id)

        assert_response_status(200)
        assert_resource_type(:patient)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

### Discovery Group

The Discovery Group ([STU1](https://github.com/inferno-framework/smart-app-launch-test-kit/blob/main/lib/smart_app_launch/discovery_stu1_group.rb)
and [STU2](https://github.com/inferno-framework/smart-app-launch-test-kit/blob/main/lib/smart_app_launch/discovery_stu2_group.rb))
examines a server's CapabilityStatement and `.well-known/smart-configuration`
endpoint to determine its configuration.

**ids:** `smart_discovery`, `smart_discovery_stu2`

**inputs:** `url`

**outputs:**
* `well_known_configuration` - The contents of `.well-known/smart-configuration`
* `smart_authorization_url`
* `smart_introspection_url`
* `smart_management_url`
* `smart_registration_url`
* `smart_revocation_url`
* `smart_token_url`

### Standalone Launch Group

The Standalone Launch Group ([STU1](https://github.com/inferno-framework/smart-app-launch-test-kit/blob/main/lib/smart_app_launch/standalone_launch_group.rb)
and [STU2](https://github.com/inferno-framework/smart-app-launch-test-kit/blob/main/lib/smart_app_launch/standalone_launch_group_stu2.rb))
performs the entire standalone launch workflow.

**ids:** `smart_standalone_launch`, `smart_standalone_launch_stu2`

**inputs:** `url`, `client_id`, `client_secret`, `requested_scopes`

**outputs:**
* `smart_credentials` - An [OAuthCredentials
  Object](https://inferno-framework.github.io/inferno-core/docs/Inferno/DSL/OAuthCredentials.html)
  containing the credentials obtained from the launch.
* `token_retrieval_time`
* `id_token`
* `refresh_token`
* `access_token`
* `expires_in`
* `patient_id`
* `encounter_id`
* `received_scopes`
* `intent`

**options:**
* `redirect_uri`: You should not have to manually set this if the `INFERNO_HOST`
  environment variable is set.
* `ignore_missing_scopes_check`: Forego checking that the scopes granted by the
 token match those requested.

### EHR Launch Group

The EHR Launch Group ([STU1](https://github.com/inferno-framework/smart-app-launch-test-kit/blob/main/lib/smart_app_launch/ehr_launch_group.rb)
and [STU2](https://github.com/inferno-framework/smart-app-launch-test-kit/blob/main/lib/smart_app_launch/ehr_launch_group_stu2.rb))
performs the entire EHR launch workflow.

**ids:** `smart_ehr_launch`, `smart_ehr_launch_stu2`

**inputs:** `url`, `client_id`, `client_secret`, `requested_scopes`

**outputs:**
* `smart_credentials` - An [OAuthCredentials

  during the launch
* `redirect_uri`: You should not have to manually set this if the `INFERNO_HOST`
  environment variable is set.
* `launch_uri`: You should not have to manually set this if the `INFERNO_HOST`
  environment variable is set.
* `ignore_missing_scopes_check`: Forego checking that the scopes granted by the
 token match those requested.
