      This group of tests validates the contents of the token introspection response by comparing the fields and/or

      in which the access token was given to the client.

      input_instructions %(
        There are two categories of input for this test group: 

        1. The access token response values, which will dictate what the tests will expect to find in the token
        introspection response.  If the Request New Access Token group was run, these inputs will auto-populate.
        
        2. The token introspection response bodies. If the Issue Introspection Request test group was run, these will
        auto-populate; otherwise, the tester will need to an run out-of-band INTROSPECTION requests for a. An ACTIVE
        access token, AND b. An INACTIVE OR INVALID token

        See [RFC-7662](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7662#section-2) for details on active vs inactive tokens.

      description %(
        This test will check whether the metadata in the token introspection response is correct for an active token and
        that the response data matches the data in the original access token and/or access token response from the
        authorization server, including the following:

        Required:
        * `active` claim is set to true
        * `scope`, `client_id`, and `exp` claim(s) match between introspection response and access token

        It is not possible to know what the expected value for `exp` is in advance, so Inferno tests that the claim is
        present and represents a time greater than or equal to 10 minutes in the past. 

        Conditionally Required:
        * IF launch context parameter(s) included in access token, introspection response includes claim(s) for 
        launch context parameter(s) 
          * Parameters checked for are `patient` and `encounter`
        * IF identity token was included as part of access token response, `iss` and `sub` claims are present in the
        introspection response and match those of the orignal ID token

        Optional but Recommended:
        * IF identity token was included as part of access token response, `fhirUser` claim SHOULD be present in 
        introspection response and should match the claim in the ID token
