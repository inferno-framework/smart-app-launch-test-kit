    description %(
      Verify that Bundle of User Access Brands and Endpoints contains Endpoints that are valid
      Endpoint resources according to the [User Access Endpoint Profile](https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/STU2.2/StructureDefinition-user-access-endpoint.html).

      Along with validating the Endpoint resources, this test also ensures that each endpoint contains a primary brand
      by checking if it is referenced by at least 1 Organization resource.
