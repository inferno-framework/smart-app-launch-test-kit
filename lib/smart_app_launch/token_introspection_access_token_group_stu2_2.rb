    description %(
      These tests are repeated from the Standalone Launch tests in order to receive a new, active access token that
      will be provided for token introspection. This test group may be skipped if the tester can obtain an access token
      __and__ the contents of the access token response body by some other means.

      These tests are currently designed such that the token introspection URL must be present in the SMART well-known endpoint.
