    title 'Authorization request fails when client supplies invalid JWT token'
    description <<~DESCRIPTION
      The [SMART App Launch 2.0.0 IG section on Backend Services](https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/STU2/backend-services.html#request-1)
      defines the required fields for the authorization request, made via HTTP POST to authorization 
      token endpoint.
      This includes the `client_assertion` parameter, where the value must be
      a valid JWT as specified in 
      [Asymmetric (public key) Client Authentication](https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/STU2/client-confidential-asymmetric.html#authenticating-to-the-token-endpoint)
      The JWT SHALL include the following claims, and SHALL be signed with the clientâ€™s private key.

      | JWT Claim | Required? | Description |
      | --- | --- | --- |
      | `iss` | required | Issuer of the JWT -- the client's `client_id`, as determined during registration with the FHIR authorization server (note that this is the same as the value for the sub claim) |
      | `sub` | required | The service's `client_id`, as determined during registration with the FHIR authorization server (note that this is the same as the value for the `iss` claim) |
      | `aud` | required | The FHIR authorization server's "token URL" (the same URL to which this authentication JWT will be posted) |
      | `exp` | required | Expiration time integer for this authentication JWT, expressed in seconds since the "Epoch" (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC). This time SHALL be no more than five minutes in the future. |
      | `jti` | required | A nonce string value that uniquely identifies this authentication JWT. |

      The [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework Section 4.3.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.3.3) 
      describes the proper response for an invalid request in the client credentials grant flow:

      "If the request failed client authentication or is invalid, the authorization server returns an
      error response as described in [Section 5.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-5.2)."
